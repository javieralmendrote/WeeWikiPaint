Engineering Tasks

To Do on current task:

Future ideas
- Create 'fail fast' assertion code??
- Abstract test framework? (Swap out a different framework to make sure abstraction works)
- Static checking of function parameters (rather than writing tests)
- Handle errors properly in server.js

Notes:
- It seems like NodeUnit doesn't work properly on Windows.
